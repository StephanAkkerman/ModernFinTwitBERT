## Introduction

**ModernFinTwitBERT** is a transformer-based sentiment analysis model fine-tuned specifically for financial Twitter (FinTwit) content. It builds on top of [ModernBERT](https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/ModernBERT), a lightweight and optimized language model for modern short-form text, and is trained to accurately classify tweets related to stocks, finance, and investing into sentiment categories such as bullish, bearish, or neutral.

This project aims to provide a fast, lightweight, and domain-adapted model for analyzing financial discourse on social media. It is ideal for researchers, retail traders, and data scientists interested in extracting sentiment signals from noisy, fast-moving FinTwit data.

## Key Features üîë

- ‚úÖ Built on top of **ModernBERT** for optimized performance on short-form content  
- üß† Fine-tuned on tens of thousands of labeled FinTwit examples  
- üí¨ Supports multi-class sentiment classification (e.g. bullish / bearish / neutral)  
- ‚ö° Lightweight & efficient ‚Äî suitable for real-time applications  
- üõ† Easy integration with other NLP or finance pipelines  

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

The required packages to run this code can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/ModernFinTwitBERT.git
```

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è
You can load the model using transformers and run predictions on FinTwit content
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("StephanAkkerman/ModernFinTwitBERT")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("StephanAkkerman/ModernFinTwitBERT")

tweet = "Feeling bullish on $AAPL after that earnings call!"
inputs = tokenizer(tweet, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()

print(f"Predicted sentiment: {predicted_class}")
```
>    Tip: Label mappings and sentiment categories are defined in the config or id2label dictionary of the model.
